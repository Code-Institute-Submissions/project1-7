# Project 1
Build a website for a band called Cult of Luna. It provides information about the band, their music, tour dates, means of contact, and social media presence.
## UX
Their official website is very minimalistic (and also have changed a bit since I started the project) and I wanted to create something that will offer a user more information and also showcase their music.  
  
It consists of six sections.  
The about section displays an image with the band members and also provides information about music they create.  
The photos section.  
The music section which displays their albums and also have a Spotify player embedded.  
The video section which contains a video from a concert.  
The tour section displays all their future shows and provides links to websites where the tickets can be bought.  
The contact section provides a newsletter sign up form and email addresses.  
The footer contains links to social media sites.
